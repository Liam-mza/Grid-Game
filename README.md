# WALKTHROUGH

-> LVL SELECTOR - It is the main room. Choose the first door starting from the left, the 3 doors on the rightmost should be closed.

-> LVL 1 - It’s just a test, you can walk around the room and notice the animation of the player. To leave the room just go into the only door in the room.

-> LVL 2 - In this room you can collect an apple by pressing the correct control, this apple should then disappear. To leave the room go into the only door in the room.

-> LVL 3 - If you have entered this room you have to solve the problem and open the door protected by three rocks. You cannot go through the door in which you just came in through. 
  - !!Solution to the problem!! : you have to collect the key in the bottom-left corner to open the door, activate all the pressure-switches in the middle of the room to remove the middle rock, then you should be able to exit the room. If you wish to remove all the rocks, just activate the torch, activate all the levers except from the one in the middle, and step on the pressure-plate. Note: If you wish to move faster in order to solve the problem faster, sprint! -> LVL 4 - This room is a bonus room, you should find a present for you, which is going to be a bird that flies next to you . - To exit the room, just take the door. -> LVL 5 - This room is a little bit more complex. In this room you will have to find and activate 2 levers (one at the top-left corner of the room, the other at the bottom), 1 pressure-switch (you will find it easily), 1 torch (next to the house) and 1 pressure-plate (top right corner). Once found and activated, rocks are going to disappear at the top-right corner of the image, giving you a way to get a key. This key will unlock the door to get out of the room. Note: Be careful with the spikes!
